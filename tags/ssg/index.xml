      <description>I am mostly writing this so that I won&amp;rsquo;t forget for the next time I want to deploy a static site to GitHub pages. I should say a static site that is not a Jekyll site because a Jekyll site is different and more of an automated process since GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll.
With Hugo, there are a few more steps to accomplish to get your site deployed to GitHub pages.</description>

      <description>Recently my team has been looking to update our tooling for a couple of reasons. The main reason is our current tool, MadCap Flare, has become difficult to work with since our project has greatly increased in size. We have well over 2,000 topics and because of our hefty project size, sometimes Flare will time out and adding things like links can become cumbersome. We had discussed simply breaking the project into several Flare projects and then somehow merging the projects upon build time, but since we use Git as our source control and we use conditional text throughout the project, that process could get very complicated.</description>
