      <title>Creating custom shortcodes for Hugo when you are using a theme</title>

      <description>This is another post I am writing because I want to remember how to do it and the documentation I needed to understand this concept was not easily found, so this is a reference for me for later. ðŸ“Œ The Hugo docs covering custom shortcodes is good, but it assumes you are not using a theme and I am for my blog site.
I wanted to create some admonitions in posts for my blog; however, the theme I am using, Minimal, does not include shortcodes for admonitions.</description>

      <description>I am mostly writing this so that I won&amp;rsquo;t forget for the next time I want to deploy a static site to GitHub pages. I should say a static site that is not a Jekyll site because a Jekyll site is different and more of an automated process since GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll.
With Hugo, there are a few more steps to accomplish to get your site deployed to GitHub pages.</description>
